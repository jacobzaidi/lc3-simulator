Part1.c and Part1.cpp converts each line of an assembly program into hexadecimal form.

Part2.c  and Part2.cpp implements an LC-3 simulator that is capable of executing the following instructions:
 * LD
 * LEA
 * LDI
 * AND
 * NOT
 * ADD

The following assembly programs are provided within the simulator for testing:
 * p1.obj
 * p2.obj
 * p3.obj
 * p4.obj
 * p5.obj
 * p6.obj
 * p7.obj

To run the files:

type	gcc Part1.c	(or Part2.c)
	a.exe p1.obj	(can choose from p1-p7.obj)

or	g++ Part1.cpp	(or Part2.cpp)
	a.exe p1.obj	(can choose from p1-p7.obj)
